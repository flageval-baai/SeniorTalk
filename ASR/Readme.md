# Baseline Implementation with WeNet

We provide a baseline implementation using the open-source [WeNet](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet) toolkit.

## Steps to Run the Baseline

1. Clone the WeNet repository.
2. Read the [README](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet/tree/main/examples/aishell/paraformer/README.md) download the pretrained Paraformer or train from scratch using conformer, transformer and E-branchformer 
3. Modify all `run.sh` to update the local paths according to your setup.
4. Run all `run.sh` to execute the baseline model.
